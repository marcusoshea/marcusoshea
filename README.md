- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m iteratively improving a polling application I created for organizations to poll whether to allow new members into the organization. Tech used is (API) Nest.JS, Postgres, (Front-End) Angular. I am serving it up using AWS, with a small server for web, a small server for API and a dedicated DB server.
